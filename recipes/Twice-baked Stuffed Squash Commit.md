# Twice-baked Stuffed Squash Commit 

> In this recipe we make several changes to the scooped out insides of a roasted squash before committing them all back to main. We'll add a few features as part of this squash commit, including hot italian sausage, garlicky sauteed greens, and a crunchy, cheesy breadcrumb topping.
>
>
> You can fork this recipe and change the features in a number of ways. The type of squash used is flexible; I've used butternut, acorn, and delicata. The greens used are also flexible; my main GOTO is lacinto kale but you can use spinach or mustard greens (not bagged baby spinach!). If your PM has you on an unreasonable deadline and you just need to ship it, feel free to skip making your own breakcrumb topping and use panko or even crushed up croutons! Note that you will need a 12" skillet with a lid for this recipe. Makes 2-4 servings depending on your appetite!

## Ingredients

### For the Squash: 
- 1 medium butternut squash (or another winter squash as mentioned above), halved with seeds and strings removed
- 3 Tbsp olive oil, divided

- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided
- 3-4 slices hearty/rustic white bread, crusts removed and cut into 1/4" cubes (In Seattle, I used Grand Central's Sliced Como Loaf)

- 1/2 lb Italian Sausage, casings removed (hot, sweet, or mixed)

- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 1 small bunch kale, stemmed and chopped (or use another green as mentioned above, 3 loose cups)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 c water (for hearty greens, skip for spinach)

- 2 Tbsp heavy cream
- 1/4 c grated parmesan (not powder) plus more for topping
- 1 Tbsp minced fresh sage
- 1 tsp minced fresh thyme
- 1/4 tsp fresh grated nutmeg (or 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg)


## Directions

1. Place oven rack in the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400°. Line a baking sheet with foil.
### Start the Squash
2. Brush or otherwise coat the squash with 2 Tbsp olive oil. Place the squash cut side down onto the prepared baking sheet and bake until easily pierced with a knife or skewer, 40-45 minutes. Proceed with the remaining steps as the squash roasts.

### Make the Breadcrumbs
(This step is optional-skip if using panko or other premade crumbs)
3. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a large 12" skillet over medium heat. 
4. Add the cubed bread and toss to coat in the melted butter. Continue to toast the bread until golden brown and crunchy, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and set aside on paper towel to drain. 

### Make the Sausage and Greens
3. Wipe out the now empty skillet and add the remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil
4. Add the Italian sausage, breaking it up into chunks. Sauté until just cooked through, then remove to paper towel lined plate and set aside. 
5. Add the diced onion to the fat in the pan and sauté until translucent and golden, 5-10 minutes.
6. Add the chopped kale and sauté until beginning to wilt. Clear a space in center of the pan and add the minced garlic along with a bit of oil-sauté until fragrant (30 seconds) and then stir unto the kale/onion mixture. 
7. If using hearty greens: Add the 1/4 c. water and cover the pan for 2 minutes or until fully wilted and vibrant. Remove lid and continue to sauté until liquid evaporates. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Assemble and Bake
8. When the squash is fully cooked, remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle. 
9. Holding a squash half with a dishtowel, carefully scoop out the hot squash flesh into a bowl, leaving a 1/4" of flesh in the shell to maintain its structure. Leave the shells on the sheet pan.
10. Mash the squash with the remaining 2 Tbsp butter until melted and incorporated. Add the cream, parmesan, sage, thyme, and nutmeg, stiring until combined. Fold in the reserved sausage, greens, 1/2 tsp salt, and pepper to taste. Taste and adjust seasoning.
11. Divide the mixture between each shell half. Top with about a generous amount of breadcrumbs to coat and grate additional parmesan over the top.
12. Return stuffed squashes to the oven and bake until heated through, the crumbs are deep golden brown and grated parmesan are melted, about 10 minutes.
13. Cool briefly before serving. Enjoy!

### BONUS: Squash Commit Ravioli
> This filling also makes excellent ravioli! If you're fortunate enough to have access to fresh sheet pasta, simply use this filling in place of a different filling recipe, adding 2 tsp - 1 Tbsp per ravioli depending on the desired size. Seal with an egg wash and another sheet of pasta and cut using a ravioli press, fluted dough cutter, or pizza cutter. Cook in a gallon of generously salted boiling water for 2-4 minutes and drain before adding to sauce; a brown butter sage sauce would be ideal here!
