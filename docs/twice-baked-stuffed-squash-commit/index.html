    <h1>Twice-baked Stuffed Squash Commit</h1>
    <div class="credit">
         Submitted by TashasEv   from Seattle, WA 
    </div>
    <blockquote>In this recipe we make several changes to the scooped out insides of a roasted squash before committing them all back to main. We&#39;ll add a few features as part of this squash commit, including hot italian sausage, garlicky sauteed greens, and a crunchy, cheesy breadcrumb topping.
You can fork this recipe and change the features in a number of ways. The type of squash used is flexible; I&#39;ve used butternut, acorn, and delicata. The greens used are also flexible; my main GOTO is lacinto kale but you can use spinach or mustard greens (not bagged baby spinach!). If your PM has you on an unreasonable deadline and you just need to ship it, feel free to skip making your own breakcrumb topping and use panko or even crushed up croutons! Note that you will need a 12&#34; skillet with a lid for this recipe. Makes 2-4 servings depending on your appetite!</blockquote>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            
                
                <ol>
                    
                        <li>Place oven rack in the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400°. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
                    
                </ol>
            
                
                    <h3>Start the Squash</h3>
                
                <ol>
                    
                        <li>Brush or otherwise coat the squash with 2 Tbsp olive oil. Place the squash cut side down onto the prepared baking sheet and bake until easily pierced with a knife or skewer, 40-45 minutes. Proceed with the remaining steps as the squash roasts.</li>
                    
                </ol>
            
                
                    <h3>Make the Breadcrumbs</h3>
                
                <ol>
                    
                </ol>
            
                
                    <h3>Make the Sausage and Greens</h3>
                
                <ol>
                    
                        <li>Wipe out the now empty skillet and add the remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                    
                        <li>Add the Italian sausage, breaking it up into chunks. Sauté until just cooked through, then remove to paper towel lined plate and set aside.</li>
                    
                        <li>Add the diced onion to the fat in the pan and sauté until translucent and golden, 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    
                        <li>Add the chopped kale and sauté until beginning to wilt. Clear a space in center of the pan and add the minced garlic along with a bit of oil-sauté until fragrant (30 seconds) and then stir unto the kale/onion mixture.</li>
                    
                        <li>If using hearty greens: Add the 1/4 c. water and cover the pan for 2 minutes or until fully wilted and vibrant. Remove lid and continue to sauté until liquid evaporates. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                    
                </ol>
            
                
                    <h3>Assemble and Bake</h3>
                
                <ol>
                    
                        <li>When the squash is fully cooked, remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
                    
                        <li>Holding a squash half with a dishtowel, carefully scoop out the hot squash flesh into a bowl, leaving a 1/4&#34; of flesh in the shell to maintain its structure. Leave the shells on the sheet pan.</li>
                    
                        <li>Mash the squash with the remaining 2 Tbsp butter until melted and incorporated. Add the cream, parmesan, sage, thyme, and nutmeg, stiring until combined. Fold in the reserved sausage, greens, 1/2 tsp salt, and pepper to taste. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
                    
                        <li>Divide the mixture between each shell half. Top with about a generous amount of breadcrumbs to coat and grate additional parmesan over the top.</li>
                    
                        <li>Return stuffed squashes to the oven and bake until heated through, the crumbs are deep golden brown and grated parmesan are melted, about 10 minutes.</li>
                    
                        <li>Cool briefly before serving. Enjoy!</li>
                    
                </ol>
